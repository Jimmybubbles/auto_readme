challenges

syntatically the challenge was understanding the formatting of the readme and the inquier package. using NPM is pretty straight forward but the file system bent the mind a bit as to get the information to generate to another page. I like node and feel that i will get better alot quicker than the previous html css part of the course. template strings were something I missed and it makes alot more sense now using the ${ } to populate the data.

inquirer is a great package it reminds me of the old word games so will be using it to make a game to practise using npm.
